## Case 1

A big company has decided to store information about its projects and employees in a database. The company has wisely chosen to hire you as a database designer. Prepare an E-R diagram for this Company according to the following description:

### Description:

- The company has a number of employees. Each employee has:
  - **SSN**
  - **Birth Date**
  - **Gender**
  - **Name** (represented as **Fname** and **Lname**).

- The company has a set of departments. Each department has:
  - **DName**
  - **DNUM** (unique)
  - **Locations**.

- Employees work in several projects. Each project has:
  - **PName**
  - **PNumber** (identifier)
  - **Location**
  - **City**.

- Each employee may have a set of dependents. Each dependent has:
  - **Dependent Name** (unique)
  - **Gender**
  - **Birth Date**.

**Note:** If the employee leaves the company, there is no need to store information about their dependents.

- For each department:
  - There is always one employee assigned to manage that department.
  - Each manager has a **Hiring Date**.

- Relationships:
  - Department may have employees, but an employee must work in only one department.
  - Each department may have a set of projects, and each project must be assigned to one department.
  - Employees work on several projects, and each project has several employees.
  - Each employee has a number of working hours for each project.
  - Each employee has a supervisor.!
